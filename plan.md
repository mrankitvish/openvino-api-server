Creating an OpenAI-compatible API server using Python, FastAPI, and OpenVINO involves several steps and considerations. Below is a detailed specification and requirements list for building this server:

Specification
1. Project Overview
Name: OpenVINO-Server
Purpose: To create an API server that mimics the OpenAI API but uses OpenVINO for inference.
Technology Stack: Python, FastAPI, OpenVINO, Uvicorn (ASGI server)
2. Functional Requirements
API Endpoints:
```
/v1/chat/completions: Endpoint to generate text completions using OpenVINO models.
/v1/models: Endpoint to list available models.
/v1/health: Endpoint to check the health of the server.
```
Model Inference:

Use OpenVINO to load and run inference on models compatible with text generation tasks.
Support for dynamic model loading and unloading.
Request/Response Format:

Mimic OpenAI's request and response JSON formats for compatibility.
Handle input prompts and generate text completions.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for invalid requests, model loading failures, and inference errors.
Provide meaningful error messages and status codes.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Optimize for low-latency inference using OpenVINO's optimizations.
Support batch processing of requests to improve throughput.
Scalability:

Design the server to handle multiple concurrent requests.
Consider horizontal scaling by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.
Security:

Implement API key authentication to secure endpoints.
Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging for requests, responses, and errors.
Set up monitoring to track server performance and usage metrics.
Detailed Requirements

    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 5,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 17
  }
}
```

/v1/models
Method: GET
Response Body:
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "model_name",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1677652288,
      "owned_by": "organization_name"
    }
  ]
}
```

/v1/health

Method: GET
Response Body:
```
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

2. Model Management
Model Loading:

Implement a mechanism to load OpenVINO models from disk or a model repository.
Support for different model architectures compatible with text generation.
Model Inference:

Use OpenVINO's inference engine to run models.
Handle tokenization and detokenization for text processing.
3. Security
API Key Authentication:

Implement middleware to validate API keys for each request.
Store API keys securely and provide a mechanism to generate and revoke keys.
HTTPS:

Configure the server to use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
4. Monitoring and Logging
Logging:

Log requests, responses, and errors to a file or a logging service.
Include timestamps, request IDs, and other relevant metadata.
Monitoring:

Set up monitoring to track server performance, such as request latency, throughput, and error rates.
Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization.
Implementation Steps
Set Up the Project:

Create a new Python project and set up a virtual environment.
Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, OpenVINO, and other necessary dependencies.
Develop API Endpoints:

Implement the /v1/chat/completions, /v1/models, and /v1/health endpoints using FastAPI.
Integrate OpenVINO:

Write code to load and run inference on OpenVINO models.
Implement text processing functions for tokenization and detokenization.
Implement Security Features:

Add API key authentication middleware.
Configure HTTPS for the server.
Set Up Logging and Monitoring:

Implement logging for requests and errors.
Set up monitoring tools to track server performance.
Test the Server:

Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the server functions correctly.
Perform load testing to evaluate performance and scalability.
Deploy the Server:

Deploy the server to a production environment.
Set up a load balancer for horizontal scaling.
By following these specifications and requirements, you can create a robust OpenAI-compatible API server using Python, FastAPI, and OpenVINO.
